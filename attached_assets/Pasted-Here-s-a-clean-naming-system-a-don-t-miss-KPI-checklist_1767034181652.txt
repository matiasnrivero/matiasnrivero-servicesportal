Here’s a clean naming system + a “don’t-miss” KPI checklist + a Replit-ready scope you can paste straight into your vibe-coding prompt.

## 1) Copywriting: dashboard section titles (A, B, C, D)

### A) Jobs (status KPIs)

**Title options (pick 1):**

* **Job Operations**
* **Work Queue**
* **Production Pipeline**
* **Operational Status**

**Recommended:** **Job Operations** (clear + admin-friendly)

---

### B) Sales / Cost / Profit / Margin

**Title options:**

* **Financial Performance**
* **Revenue & Profitability**
* **Sales & Margin**
* **P&L Snapshot**

**Recommended:** **Financial Performance**

---

### C) “Top” tables (Clients / Services / Bundles)

This section is basically “what’s driving the business”.

**Title options:**

* **Top Drivers**
* **Demand Leaders**
* **Sales Leaders**
* **Performance Breakdown**

**Recommended:** **Top Drivers**

---

### D) Graphs (daily sales + daily orders)

**Title options:**

* **Trends**
* **Daily Trends**
* **Performance Over Time**
* **Daily Activity**

**Recommended:** **Daily Trends**

---

## 2) KPI double-check: what you may be missing (high-value, admin-only)

You already have the core. These are the most useful additions for an Admin dashboard **without overcomplicating v1**:

### Jobs / SLA (highly recommended)

1. **Open Jobs (Total)**
   Sum of all non-terminal statuses (everything except Delivered/Canceled) — helps instantly gauge load.

2. **SLA Compliance %** (for delivered jobs in the selected period)

* `Delivered within SLA / Total Delivered * 100`
* Pairs perfectly with “Jobs Over SLA”.

3. **Avg Turnaround Time** (Delivered jobs)

* Avg(DeliveredAt - CreatedAt)
  This is one of the most meaningful operational KPIs.

4. **Avg Time in Status** (optional but powerful)

* Pending Assignment aging, Assigned to Vendor aging, In Progress aging
  Even if you don’t show all, show at least:
* **Oldest Pending Assignment (days)**
* **Oldest In Progress (days)**

### Financial (recommended)

5. **Avg Order Value (AOV)**

* `Total Sales / Total Orders` (orders = count of jobs that are billable)

6. **Refunds / Credits Issued** (if cancellations can trigger refunds)

* You already track Canceled jobs; finance should reflect it.

### Vendors (recommended if you already have vendor assignment + costs)

7. **Top Vendors by Volume** + **On-time % by Vendor**
   Even a simple table: Vendor / Jobs / On-time % / Avg TAT
   This becomes your vendor management control panel.

### Services (nice-to-have)

8. **Service Mix %** (top services share of total orders)
   Useful, but can wait if you want to keep v1 lean.

If you want to keep V1 strict: add **Open Jobs**, **SLA Compliance %**, **Avg Turnaround Time**, **AOV**. Those four deliver huge value.

---

## 3) Replit-ready detailed scope (pasteable)

### Goal

Build **Admin Dashboard** as the **default landing page after Admin login** for “Services Portal”. Provide KPI cards + top tables + 2 daily trend charts. Include a **Time Period Date Selector** (default: **current month**) that filters *all* metrics.

---

### Navigation / Layout Requirements

* Top bar left shows brand text: **“Services Portal”**.
* **Make “Services Portal” clickable** → navigates to `/admin/dashboard` (home).
* No extra menu items in top bar (space constraint).
* Dashboard route: `/admin/dashboard` (or `/dashboard` if admin-only app).

---

### Global Filter: Time Period Selector

* Component: date range selector with presets:

  * Current Month (default)
  * Last Month
  * Last 7 days
  * Custom range
* Default range:

  * Start = first day of current month (local timezone)
  * End = today (or end of month; pick one and be consistent—recommend: **today**)
* This filter drives all queries (KPIs, tables, graphs).

---

### Data Definitions (must be consistent)

**Job statuses (admin-facing):**

* Pending Assignment
* Assigned to Vendor
* In Progress
* Delivered
* Change Request
* Canceled

**Client-facing mapping (FYI, not needed on admin dashboard):**

* “Pending” for client includes Pending Assignment + Assigned to Vendor (and optionally others per your earlier logic)

**SLA rule:**

* Each Job has an SLA target datetime: `slaDueAt`
* “Over SLA” means:

  * `status != Delivered` AND `status != Canceled` AND `now > slaDueAt`

**Money fields:**

* `totalSales` = what the client paid for the service job(s) (gross)
* `vendorCost` = your vendor payout / internal cost
* `profit = totalSales - vendorCost`
* `marginPercent = profit / totalSales * 100` (guard divide-by-zero)

---

### Dashboard Sections (UI + metrics)

#### Section 1: **Job Operations**

**KPI cards (count):**

* Pending Assignment Jobs
* Assigned to Vendor Jobs
* In Progress Jobs
* Delivered Jobs
* Change Request Jobs
* Canceled Jobs
* Jobs Over SLA

**(Recommended add-ons for v1.1 or v1 if easy)**

* Open Jobs (Total) = all except Delivered & Canceled
* SLA Compliance % (Delivered within SLA / Delivered)
* Avg Turnaround Time (DeliveredAt - CreatedAt)

**Behavior**

* Clicking a KPI card should navigate to job list with filters:

  * `/admin/jobs?status=IN_PROGRESS`
  * `/admin/jobs?overSla=true`
  * Date range should persist in URL query params.

---

#### Section 2: **Financial Performance**

**KPI cards:**

* Total Sales
* Vendor Cost
* Profit
* Margin %

**(Recommended add-on)**

* AOV = Total Sales / Total Orders (billable jobs count)

**Formatting**

* Currency formatting: `$12,345.67`
* Margin %: `34.2%`
* If Total Sales = 0 → show Profit = 0 and Margin = “—”

---

#### Section 3: **Top Drivers**

**Table 1: Top Clients**
Columns:

* Client Name
* Total Requests (job count)
* Total Sales

Rules:

* Group by clientId within date range
* Sort by Total Sales desc
* Top 10 (or Top 5 if compact)
* Row click → `/admin/jobs?clientId=...`

**Table 2: Top Selling Services**
Columns:

* Service Name
* Total Sales
  (Optionally add “Orders”)

Rules:

* Group by serviceId (or serviceName snapshot)
* Sort by Total Sales desc

**Table 3: Top Selling Bundles**
Columns:

* Bundle Name
* Total Sales
  (Optionally add “Orders”)

Rules:

* Group by bundleId
* If a job is not a bundle, exclude from this table.

---

#### Section 4: **Daily Trends**

Charts (2):

1. **Daily Sales ($)**
2. **Daily Service Orders**

**X-axis tick requirements**

* Show **15 tick labels** on the bottom axis
* Label **every other day**
* Works for monthly view (typically ~30 days → every 2 days = ~15 labels)
* If custom range isn’t ~30 days, apply an algorithm:

  * choose ~15 evenly spaced ticks, but never more than 15 labels

**Chart interactions**

* Hover tooltip: date + value
* Clicking a date point/bar can optionally navigate to filtered job list by that day.

---

### API / Query Scope (backend or mock)

You need endpoints (or server functions) that accept:

* `startDate`
* `endDate`

Suggested endpoints:

* `GET /api/admin/dashboard/summary?start=...&end=...`

  * returns:

    * jobCountsByStatus
    * jobsOverSlaCount
    * totalSales, vendorCost, profit, marginPercent
    * optional: openJobsCount, slaCompliancePercent, avgTurnaroundHours, aov
* `GET /api/admin/dashboard/top-clients?start=...&end=...`
* `GET /api/admin/dashboard/top-services?start=...&end=...`
* `GET /api/admin/dashboard/top-bundles?start=...&end=...`
* `GET /api/admin/dashboard/daily-sales?start=...&end=...`
* `GET /api/admin/dashboard/daily-orders?start=...&end=...`

---

### Acceptance Criteria

* Admin lands on dashboard after login.
* “Services Portal” top-left navigates to dashboard.
* Changing date range refreshes all KPIs/tables/charts.
* KPIs match the status definitions exactly.
* “Jobs Over SLA” follows `now > slaDueAt` and excludes Delivered/Canceled.
* Charts show daily aggregates across the selected period with ~15 x-axis labels.

## If you want, I can also write the exact microcopy for each KPI card label (short labels vs long labels) + the query-param schema so your dashboard filters stay consistent across Jobs List + Dashboard.
