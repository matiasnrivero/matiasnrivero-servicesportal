I didn't test phase 3. I will do it later. But I want to make sure you are following this 7 phases plan that you gave me? Because I can imagine that each title and subtitle (feature) that is described in this plan, has tons of more specifications attach to them that we've been discussing all day! If you are possitive about this, let's move into phase 4, and then tomorrow I will test Phase 3 and 4. Here is the roadmap you planned for me?
Build Plan: Monthly Packs Payment System
Phase 1: Core Pack Structure & Schema
Restrict Pack Editor to single service (remove +Add, replace with Save)
Add validation: no duplicate service+quantity combinations
Add stripeSubscriptionId, stripeStatus, gracePeriodEndsAt, pendingPackChange, vendorAssigneeId to pack subscriptions
Create Tri-POD internal vendor with all internal designers
Phase 2: Pack Subscription & Stripe Integration
Client subscription flow (from Services > Monthly Packs and Payment tab)
Stripe subscription creation on subscribe (immediate first charge)
Anniversary billing for renewals
Webhook handlers for payment success/fail/cancel
2-week grace period with banner
Phase 3: Pack Usage Tracking & Display
Track pack consumption on service request submission (CST timezone)
"Included in Pack" badge on Service Request List
Pack usage display on Client Dashboard (with 90% warning)
Pack consumption columns on Payment > Monthly Packs section
Toggle for Internal Designers to show/hide pack requests
Phase 4: Upgrade/Downgrade & Unsubscribe
Upgrade/Downgrade flow (effective next cycle)
Pending change display and cancellation
Unsubscribe flow (keep benefits until cycle end)
Phase 5: Pack Assignment to Vendors
New Pack Assignment Screen (Admin/Internal Designer)
Bulk and individual assignment with modal
Pending Assignment highlighting
Reassignment effective next period
Phase 6: Reports & Dashboard Updates
Pack Profit Report (separate from Services Profit)
Deduct from Royalties Report (2 tabs: Services, Packs)
Vendor Payments Report - Packs Tab
Update Services Profit Report (hide $0 pack services)
Dashboard KPIs: Packs Profit, Total Profit
Client Dashboard with pack usage + job operations
Vendor Dashboard - pack consumption section
Phase 7: Billing Logic for Payment Types
Pay as you Go: Immediate overage charges
Monthly Payment: Consolidated overage charge on 1st
Deduct from Royalties: Manual mark as paid functionality
